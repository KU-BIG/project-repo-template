# Template for project repositories

Note: This is still a work in progress.

## Problem statement
Before this example repo, team members had a hard time understanding the expectations for what the repo and associated milestones should look like. This repo provides a concrete (though abstracted) instantiation.

Please include a Project Statement on your landing page. Your problem statement should be in the form of: What can CTSAs/the community not do now, that would be addressed by this project's success? A problem statement should be a clear vision and the overall method that will be used to solve the problem at hand. 

## Project description
(we will migrate these from the Project Matrix for you)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum pretium a felis non scelerisque. Etiam molestie nisi ut mi viverra dictum. Nunc et tempor quam. Maecenas a viverra sapien. Aliquam lacinia sagittis lorem ac sodales. Fusce justo mi, cursus sed metus sed, ornare vestibulum mauris. Donec in orci ornare, facilisis nisl ut, congue libero.

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. 

Point person (github handle) | Site | Responsible PI
----------|--------------|---------------
Julie McMurry (@jmcmurry) | OHSU | Melissa Haendel (@mellybelly)

## Leads 

Project scientific leadership, should be 1-3 persons. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.

Lead(s) (github handle) | Site
----------|--------------|
Julie McMurry (@jmcmurry) | OHSU 
Melissa Haendel (PD) (@mellybelly) | OHSU

## Team members 

Include any members considered part of the project team - internal to CD2H sites and community members.

Members(s) (github handle) | Site

## Repositories

List Github repositories associated with the project. Each project requires at least one repository to house the administrative tracking and public information. You can either add this information to an existing repository, or create a new one and list the associated repositories below. Please be sure to tag any repositories not under the data2health organization with the topic 'data2health'. Project repositories must be public. Some repositories may be private for sensitivity or operational reasons. 

Example repos:
- https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template
- https://github.com/data2health/operations; private repo editable by members of team @data2health/ops

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. Please invite any participants to [onboard](bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form)

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in Github using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
[Highlighted key project documentation](FIX ME)
[The project Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vLp-H32KTNobiZF2cK82At90S6dVJNUf) is accessible to onboarded participants. 

## Slack room
[The project slack room](https://cd2h.slack.com/messages/C9D9SQWEQ) is accessible to onboarded participants.

## Deliverables
Each project should propose one or more deliverables. Examples: a released code package, a best practices document, a final survey, a set of survey results, etc.

## Milestones 
Each deliverable is represented as a Milestone, but not all Milestones need be deliverables. For example, see this 'report on XYZ' is a [Deliverable Milestone](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/milestone/2)

Please create 4-8 Milestones for each project, with dates prior to August 31st.  Milestones for partially completed deliverables are acceptable: beta release of software, # interviews performed, 75% coverage, etc. 

Each Milestone must have at least one Issue (aka 'ticket'), each issue should be assigned to a person, preferably one at a time; reassignments are fine. Issues with checklists showing degree of completion are also acceptable, see [example](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/2).

## Evaluation
This project will be evaluated on the basis of how easily it is understood by members of the CD2H team who need to make their own similar repositories. 

Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md).These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have one or more Evaluation realated Milestones, see [Example Evaluation Milstone] (https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
This project provides an introductory Github tutorial for project management purposes. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate
- Best practices guides

A separate education.md file or a wiki page are two options to document educational activities and resources associated with the project. Please include an education related milestone where relevant.
