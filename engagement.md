# Engagement Plan

Engagement for Competitions is inherent in the usage model as Competitions hosts CTSA-wide competitions (grant applications and reviews)
Otherwise, technical engagement includes: 
    Piloting the platform, providing feedback (features, documentation, implementation workflows, etc), contributing to development via open source workflow e.g. GitHub fork and pull request, contributing to documentation, submitting feature requests, participating in SAML infrastructure to enable SSO (applies to all cloud-based deployments not just Competitions)

Cultural engagement includes:

    Developing use cases, being a demonstration partner, providing feedback on product design, utilizing the cloud-deployed instance, developing local implementation strategies, testing local engagement materials, seeking requirements, sharing strategies to support local projects; collaborating on best practices for local adoption, implementation, engagement, integration
