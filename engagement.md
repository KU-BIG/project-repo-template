## Engagement Plan

Engagement for Competitions is inherent in the usage model as Competitions hosts CTSA-wide competitions (grant applications and reviews)
Otherwise, technical engagement includes: 

    - Piloting the platform
    - Providing feedback (features, documentation, implementation workflows, etc)
    - Contributing to development via open source workflow e.g. GitHub fork and pull request, contributing to documentation
    - Submitting feature requests
    - Participating in SAML infrastructure to enable SSO (applies to all cloud-based deployments not just Competitions)

Cultural engagement includes:

    - Developing use cases
    - Being a demonstration partner
    - Providing feedback on product design
    - Utilizing the cloud-deployed instance
    - Developing local implementation strategies
    - Testing local engagement materials
    - Seeking requirements
    - Sharing strategies to support local projects
    - Collaborating on best practices for local adoption, implementation, engagement, integration
